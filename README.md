# Predicting-Diabetes-using-Perceptron

In order to diagnose whether an individual has diabetes or not, the Perceptron algorithm was implemented and used. A pre-processed version of the Prima Indian Diabetes database, originally from National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, was used for this study. After doing a linear separability test on the data set, it was hypothesised that a perceptron would not give fruitful results. Three different variations of the perceptron algorithm was analyzed in this study and the best most optimized perceptron implementation achieved a validation accuracy of 84.3\% and a test accuracy of 72.7\%, thus satisfying the hypothesis. From the classification results, sensitivity and specificity scores of 0.733 and 0.716 were obtained respectively. It was, however, evident that the perceptron was not that stable in this classification problem and therefore, some suggestions were made to improve results in the future.
